# The System: to do

## Today
- [ ] Bring in md content from previous project
    - [x] Copy files
    - [x] How to feed an `.md` file? (Watch [that tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsSUAOkepCw&t=412s&ab_channel=ColbyFayock) again)
    - [x] install next-mdx-remote
    - [ ] serve through a dynamic route (by id)
{/* Done for the day. */}
## Tomorrow
- Let's not go overboard with fancy components just yet
    - [ ] Set up a good file structure start organizing the notes to files and folders, all accessible via the system `url`
    - [ ] Provide an automatic site map for the newly created content

## This week
- [ ] Work on typography
    - [ ] What are the ideal leading values for the headings?
    - [ ] Vertical rythm

## In near future
- [ ] Layout
    - [ ] "Recto/Verso" is a presentational detail (`CSS`): the semantic parts should be a `<main>` and `<aside>`
    - [ ] Show date & time with task lists ([Here's how, I think...](https://medium.com/create-a-clocking-in-system-on-react/create-a-react-app-displaying-the-current-date-and-time-using-hooks-21d946971556))
- [ ] Install Frontmatter
- [ ] Install additional `md` features
- [ ] Set up a graph database ([Neo4J](#)?)

## No due date (draft ideas)
- Surely ChatGPT can help with the natural language phrasing (and translation)

### Done recently
- [x] Styling lists...
- [x] Please, let's migrate to `.mdx` and start writing a bit.

### More
- Currently playing with the [Modular scale](/modularscale)
