Productivity tips (I love those)
. Set the Screenshot location on macOS to Downloads, because this is what they are: it automatically creates an **Inbox** of things you now want to do with them without clutterning your Desktop

# The System
## Ideas
   Explore the markdown sytax and come up with possibilities
   Numbering: auto | off | manual | as is
   auto: number each heading sequentially (according to a template)
   off: ignore manually typed numbering
   manual: reorder paragraphs according to manually typed numbering
   as is: apply formatting but leave the numbering as is
   Set up a graph database
   o intuition: event1 => (happened before/after) => event2
   o photo1 => (taken) => location
   o learn the syntax (cipher query languqge)

## Features I'd love to see implemented
   o My financial situation
   o My task lists
   o as .ics to use as a Google calendar?
   o GTD framework - explore it more
   o TPD blog
   o as a Flow (feed)
   o as the dozenal grid (book spreads)
   o Markdown editor
   o Easy to edit html generator
   o tokens should be draggable boxes you can move around and shuffle

## In other developments
   More task lists
   o How to incorporate the pomodoro technique into the daily routine
   o Daily review: splitting tasks into pomodoros
   o Weekly reviews on progress
   o Nagging time/prep time/completion time (read more on time blocking)
   o Triangular shelves in the living room
   x East (done 13 nov)
   o West (this weekend)

## No scroll solution
scroll down or swipe left one screen at a time
what does not comfortably fit on the screen needs an affordance to see further screens

# How the markdown solution should work (first ideas)

1. To do # this is a Level 1 Heading (h1)
   Date: Wed 13 nov 2024

1.1 Priority 1 # this is a Level 2 Heading (h2)
Things to do today. # this is a paragraph, because it ends with a full stop (p)
x Set up next js app # this is a ticked box in a list
o Set up SCSS # this is an unticked box in a list

.card sm reversed
This should output a `div`
with the specified classes
card.

Inline elements can also
be .term(xl checked) marked up term. and should be converted to `spam`s (with extra classes in parantheses)

Possible approach
1. Feed as is
2. Progressively work in the features
3. The output should appear more and more structured
