o Play around with markdown
o Bring in some content from previous project

2. Ideas
Explore the markdown sytax and come up with possibilities
Numbering: auto | off | manual | as is
    auto: number each heading sequentially (according to a template)
    off: ignore manually typed numbering
    manual: reorder paragraphs according to manually typed numbering
    as is: apply formatting but leave the numbering as is

3. Features I'd love to see implemented
o My financial situation
o My task lists
    o as .ics to use as a Google calendar?
    o GTD framework - explore it more
o TPD blog
    o as a Flow (feed)
    o as the dozenal grid (book spreads)
O Markdown editor
    o Easy to edit html generator
    o tokens should be draggable boxes you can move around and shuffle


4. In other developments
More task lists
o How to incorporate the pomodoro technique into the daily routine
    o Daily review: splitting tasks into pomodoros
    o Weekly reviews on progress
    o Nagging time/prep time/completion time (read more on time blocking)

Learn CSS
o What is the difference between SCSS and CSS variables?
