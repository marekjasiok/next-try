### Useful html entities

- soft hyphen: `&shy;`

### Productivity tips (I love those)

- Set the Screenshot location on macOS to Downloads, because this is what they are: it automatically creates an **Inbox** of things you now want to do with them without clutterning your Desktop
- Start EVERY coding session with the git commit message - then focus on making it come true

# The System

## Ideas

Explore the markdown sytax and come up with possibilities
Numbering: auto | off | manual | as is
auto: number each heading sequentially (according to a template)
off: ignore manually typed numbering
manual: reorder paragraphs according to manually typed numbering
as is: apply formatting but leave the numbering as is
Set up a graph database

## No scroll solution

scroll down or swipe left one screen at a time
what does not comfortably fit on the screen needs an affordance to see further screens
