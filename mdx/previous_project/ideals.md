# Do ideals exist?
dim. 13 nov. 2022

Here I am, revisiting platonic ideals. I never thought I would even consider their existence. How—and where—can they exist? How can a sphere exist? How can a circle exist if it is composed of points, which have no dimension? Nobody has ever seen a circle.

Moreover, the ideal is not just any circle: it is more of a ‘circleness’ – the circularity of an object, its property of being shaped as a circle. Can such a property exist?
They are conveniently called ‘ideals’, meaning they stand for what things ‘should’ ideally be. While, in reality, it is them that are approximations of what things indeed are. The Earth's surface is not an 'imperfect' sphere: rather, a sphere is an 'imerfect' _approximation_ of the Earth's surface.

Then the next obvious question is: where do these approximations stop? Where should we stop approximating Earth’s surface? By _likening_ it to a sphere? While we know that this likeness is inaccurate for practical purposes? Shall we then model it as a _geoid_ (whatever that even means)? It is certainly more useful for some measurements. But where do we stop this _likening_? Do we wrap around every tree? Every house, street, lamp-post, bench? (They are commonly featured on maps.) If we do wrap around every tree, do we make it into a ‘tree-oid’ or should we count its every leaf? Its every xylem vessel? Or every atom composing its trunk?
Where do we finally fall back on our ‘ideal’ predicted shape and call it a day? Then finally this question—the fundamental one—do they exist?  They are certainly present in our minds. Collectively, we study them, discover their features, their proportions (their areas, angles, radii, etc.). So, in a way, they have a _non material_ existence, an _idealised_ existence in our minds. And collectively, in our body of knowledge.

Yet, nobody has ever seen a circle, let alone The Circle—the master idea of ‘circularity’, devoid of dimensions (or more exactly, of any dimension ranging from 0 to ∞). Or in three dimensions, which are more true to life, the ‘sphericity’ of space (as contrasted with the similarly common ’cubicity’ of the same space).

In no way can they exist in a material sense. But there is another sense—far more elusive—where they do have their place. Indeed, after years of denial, I am reopening the question of ideals’ existence to fresh scrutiny.
