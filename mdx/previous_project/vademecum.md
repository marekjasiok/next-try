# The System is the one source of truth

`The System` contains everything
(apart from the system itself, of course)
but you, the `World`, are its domain of discourse.
As I take you by the hand and guide you through your World, it is on you, the `Reader`, to make sense of it.

`The Ontology` is your domain of discourse.
In other words, it is your `World`

"Open world assumption states that everything we donâ€™t know is _undefined._"

# Testimonies of the Present Day

## What is my goal?
To give my testimonies.

## How do I want to show them?
In a form of a book.
However, taking advantage of web-linked text,
I may offer a multidimmensional book, with as many axes as one can imagine,
offering to the Reader quasi-infinite paths through the same book matrix.

## What is a Testimony?
Everything, really. Everything that can be witnessed (within our event horizont).
I am using photography as a medium to capture moments,
however, any device may do.

### Notes to Self
_desribe the way you take notes_
How to [link to a note.](/docs/multmd)
# Technicalities
Jinja templates can reach a complexity that would better be expressed by a python script.
I am using templates for the overall html structure.
I am leveraging Markdown with the appropriate [custom-written extension](/docs/multmd)
to bring content from various sources. It helps getting the markdown syntax "for free"
while keeping the templates easy to read and understand.
Ask for forgiveness, not permission.

## From the World to Model `->` Controller `->` View
I prefer this order, because it shows the flow of information:
in other words, things exist out there,
they are described in a dictionary (Model) `->`
we query the dictionary (Controller) `->`
the results are displayed (View).
