> Tschichold also expresses a preference for certain ratios over others: "The geometrically definable irrational page proportions like 1:1.618 (Golden Section), 1:√2, 1:√3, 1:√5, 1:1.538, and the simple rational proportions of 1:2, 2:3, 5:8 and 5:9 I call clear, intentional and definite. All others are unclear and accidental ratios. The difference between a clear and an unclear ratio, though frequently slight, is noticeable… Many books show none of the clear proportions, but accidental ones."

One viewport unit is simply 1% of the viewport and there are 4 types of viewport units:
`vw` - viewport width,
`vh` - viewport height,
`vmin `- height or width, whichever is smaller,
`vmax` - height or width, whichever is larger


"Classic Typographic Scale is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and so forth.
This scale has been used by typographers of the early Renaissance; it has remained unchanged for 400 years."
