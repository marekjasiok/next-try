## Using MathJax
*yet to be implemented*
Enclosing an expression in "dollar arrows"

`$`&#8203;`-> [[x, y, z], [a, b, c], [10, X0, 2XI]] <-`&#8203;`$`

will output:

`$-> [[x, y, z], [a, b, c], [10, X0, 2XI]] <-$`

## The Grammar
Here is a definition of the grammar used to parse AsciiMath expressions. In the Backus-Naur form given below, the letter on the left of the ::= represents a category of symbols that could be one of the possible sequences of symbols listed on the right. The vertical bar | separates the alternatives.
```
    v ::= [A-Za-z] | greek letters | numbers | other constant symbols
    u ::= sqrt | text | bb | other unary symbols for font commands
    b ::= frac | root | stackrel | other binary symbols
    l ::= ( | [ | { | (: | {: | other left brackets
    r ::= ) | ] | } | :) | :} | other right brackets
    S ::= v | lEr | uS | bSS             Simple expression
    I ::= S_S | S^S | S_S^S | S          Intermediate expression
    E ::= IE | I/I                       Expression
```
