# Sphere

We come to imagine a sphere as a ball we hold in the hand, but in fact, the sphere has no dimensions. A small sphere is as much spherical as an infinite one. They are all instances of a sphere. The sphere is just a different way of looking at space: another _projection._[^1] Instead of imagining things in straight lines, one can imagine them projected on a sphere.

# Icosahedron

It has 12 vertices formed by three orthogonal golden-ratio rectangles of equal length

The golden ratio (`$->varphi<-$`) is embedded in several properties.

Cartesian coordonates:

```
$->[[0, +-1, +-varphi], [+-1, +-varphi, 0], [+-varphi, 0, +-1]]<-$
```

As a continued fraction:

```
$->\varphi = 1 + \frac1{1 + \frac1{1 + \frac1{1 + \frac1{1 + \ddots}}}}<-$
```
