# Welcome!

The System will work for you.

On your [Left] is your *Inbox*

_What a mess..._

On your [Right] is what you have *achieved*

From here you can enter [The System](/thesystem)

Rule no. 1: None of the tasks must disappear
(unless they are deleted)
This is what you mean by "trusted system".
Anything not marked `completed` must 'hang' somewhere.

Once you delve into a task, you may refine the granularity by attaching subtasks to it. Going from a sketch of an idea to the actionnable plan.

Always decide what the next steps are before marking a task complete.
